# Purpose

A challenge to create a simple messenger app in 1.5 hours. 

Node/Express/EJS/Socket.io.

It ended up taking me around 2-2.5 hours to workout kinks, refreshing my memory on some basics, and becoming familiar with some of socket.io's documentation. It was actually fairly easy to use once I got my head around a few things I just am not very used to.

I also probably cost myself a little time thinking in EJS. It wasn't necessary for what I was doing here. I saved time by using the styling from socket.io's getting started tutorial, however.

With a little more time and effort, I would change the styling and probably add some IRC-like functionality. `/nick [new nick name]` to change the username from Guest###, `/me` actions, private messages, things of that nature.

# Useage

As easy as running `npm start` from the command line and connecting to localhost:8000.
